## Git and Github
- You can create alias and create custom commands for git
- Always try to create your projects in github first and then clone it to your computer
- Always pull changes before you push changes

### Basic Git Commands
```
git add . (Adds all changes to staged section)
git commit -m "message" (Adds all changes to git file)
git push (pushes files into github)
git pull (pulls files from github)
git status (shows currently modified files)
git branch (gets current branch)
git checkout <branch_name> (changes current branch to branch_name)
git diff HEAD HEAD~1 (compares the current head with the previous commit)
git clone <link to repository> (clones github repository)
```
